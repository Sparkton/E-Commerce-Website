# E-Commerce Website

E-Commerce Website which
1) Allows users to buy easily products of various categories.
2) Allows vendors to sell their products directly to the consumers.
3) Provides a platform to connect buyers and vendors.
4) Provides an admin page which can monitor user accounts and activity.

This website is based on the principles of software engineering.

An e-commerce website makes the buying of products easy and hassle free. Users can buy a product online through
secure means and have it delivered to their doorstep. To make this happen, an easy to use website is what we aim to
make. We need a selection interface that allows users to go through the selection of products offered. We also need to
develop an easy interface for vendors from which they can put products up for sale along with the productâ€™s description.
Admin rights will be there for super users who check legitimacy of the product and users.
